<p>Thank you for taking time to do our frontend coding test. It is inspired by a real world problem we faced and includes two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>The coding test</li>
<li>A few followup questions</li>
</ul>
<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>BriteCore's clients use our platform to manage all aspects of their business, including tracking open claims, sending out monthly bills and running annual reports.</p>
<p>As a result, many of our pages are data heavy, and we often use a data table component for display and modifying this information. A data table component is similar to a classic HTML table, but includes other features.</p>
<p>A component to display this data should include the following functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Displaying data in sortable columns</li>
<li>Filtering data based on different parameters</li>
<li>Searching data</li>
<li>Actions that can be taken on each data item, or applied to all items in the table.</li>
<li>Effective display and user experience across resolutions</li>
</ul>
<h2>The Coding Test</h2>
<p>We would like you to create you own data table component. For this test, download the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1eBsATYdeISUGjdBr0SzNhY5Ur9mkl0u11tfhxn2Y1WE/edit?usp=sharing">data</a> in CSV format to your own computer. This is mock payment data for one of our products. This data includes a description field, which the user will need to be able to customize.</p>
<h3>User Stories</h3>
<p>As a payment supervisor, I would like to be able to view recent payments logged in the system, so that I can understand all the transactions that have been made.</p>
<p>As a payment supervisor, I would like to be able to edit the descriptions of recent payments easily, so that others can clearly understand why a payment was made.</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>Take as much or as little time as you would like to complete the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Satisfy the user stories outlined above.</li>
<li>Include tests for your component.</li>
<li>Feel free to use any frontend framework you'd like. Your solution can also leverage different plugins/tools, but the data table component you create should be your own, and not one provided by a UI pattern library.</li>
<li><strong>Bonus Points!</strong>: Use of Vuejs.</li>
<li><strong>Bonus Points!</strong>: As you'll be working alongside a design team regularly, an attention to visual polish and UX would be great to see.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Deliverables</h3>
<p>One of the major goals in this project is to see how you fill in ambiguities in your own creative way. There is no such thing as a perfect project here, just interpretations of the instructions above, so be creative in your approach.</p>
<p>In order to move your application forward, deliverables will include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A deployed version of your project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A GitHub repo containing your project. Your repo must contain these three things:</p>
<ul>
<li>A README that explains your approach and deployment method</li>
<li>Your code solution to this test</li>
<li>The Javascript file called <code>quiz.js</code> that contains what you used to solve the debugging quiz</li>
<li>A JSON file called <code>description.json</code> that describes you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adding of these items to your resume's cover letter:</p>
<ul>
<li>The link to the GitHub repo that lists this project</li>
<li>The link to the deployed version of your project</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uploading of your resume with cover letter in PDF or DOCX format by <a href="https://hire.withgoogle.com/public/jobs/britecorecom/view/P_AAAAAAEAADyA3tktMd8cuW">clicking this link</a></p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Follow-up Questions</h3>
<p>Bonus points if your README answers these questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>How long did you spend on the test? Would you do anything differently if you had more time?</li>
<li>In what ways would you adapt your component so that it could be used in many different scenarios where a data table is required?</li>
<li>What is one CSS property that you recently learned about that helped you solve a problem?</li>
</ol>
<h2>Evaluation</h2>
<p>If you'd like to do very well on this project, we'll hand you the categories we utilize to score candidates! They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business requirements are met or exceeded</li>
<li>Documentation in clearly written English</li>
<li>Component is written in a reusable way</li>
<li>JS contains appropriate models and DOM interactions</li>
<li>Component styling is well structured and shows understanding of advanced CSS concepts.</li>
<li>Test coverage is complete and meaningful</li>
<li>Example can be run in as few steps as possible</li>
<li>Communication is positive and respectful</li>
</ul>
